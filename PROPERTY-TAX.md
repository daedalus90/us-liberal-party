Our property tax system is driving up prices, and encourages poor use of valuable land.

Let me present you with two properties in Renton, WA. These properties are within King County, one of the highest priced counties in the country.

Property 1, I'll refer to it **the hole**

* King County Parcel Number 7231500390
* Is literally a hole in the ground. Going off Google maps it looks like it was abandoned after a fire before 2008. Since at least 2014 it has been an empty lot.
* Taxable property value: $166,000. $0 of improvements tax value, and $166,000 of land value tax.
* Owned by an investment company.

Property 2, I'll refer to it as **the home**

* King County Parcel Number 7231500395
* Right next door to **the hole**, and the same lot size.
* Average looking single family home. Currently occupied.
* Taxable property value: $361,000. $207,000 of improvements tax value, and $166,000 of land value tax.

**The hole** is diminishing the value of all neighboring properties, is sitting unused in an area with high rates of homelessness, and is not contributing to the local economy in any shape or form. It is in all senses, a useless **hole.**

**The home** is housing a family, who most likely have at least one adult working in the area, and is likely supporting local businesses (assuming this family requires food for sustenance)

Because of the current property tax system, **the hole** which again, is a drain on the local economy, pays less than half the property taxes of **the home.**

What I'm proposing, is we scrap the improvements portion of property taxes in this state, and substantially increase the Land Value Tax.

For example, if we increased the LVT by double. The two properties would be taxed equally. **The hole's** taxable value would double, hopefully encouraging the current owners to sell, or develop the property. **The home's** taxable value would drop by roughly $30k.

The current system punishes people with somewhat arbitrary valuations on "improvements" and encourages holding onto land as a speculative investment.

It makes no sense that our current tax system, by definition, punishes people for making improvements to a plot of land, especially when these improvements themselves contribute to the local economy, and in turn, state tax revenue.

TL;DR - Stop taxing improvements on real estate, instead increase the tax on the underlying land.
